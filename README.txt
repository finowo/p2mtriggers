HOW TO DOWNLOAD.

On github click on the 'Code' button, and click 'Download ZIP'
Or you can use this link https://github.com/PortalRex/p2mtriggers/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

There are 4 folders inside of 'p2mtriggers-master'
The 'SP' and 'Coop' folders HAVE TO GO INSIDE OF YOUR CFG FOLDER: 'Steam\steamapps\common\Portal 2\portal2\cfg'
SP LiveSplit Splits and Coop LiveSplit Splits can go anywhere; this is where you will open the splits from.

If you have the intention of using the LiveSplit Splits, you have to have the sar.asl setup or this will not work.
You can find more about that in the #help channel in the Portal 2 Speedrun Server.

You need to put SPmtriggers.cfg and Coopmtriggers.cfg in your cfg folder.
Along with that please put the following commands in your autoexec.cfg.

exec SPmtriggers.cfg
exec Coopmtriggers.cfg

If you want to use livesplit with CM you will need to do sar_speedrun_IL 1.
After every finished run you will have to reset LiveSplit.
You can make a global hotkey to reset and set it to be your restart_level key or something similar.
